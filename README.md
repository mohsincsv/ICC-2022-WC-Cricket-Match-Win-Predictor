# ICC-2022-WC-Cricket-Match-Win-Predictor

![WC Logo](wc.jpg)

I used Machine Learning to make a model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to predict the match win of ICC WC 2022.

## Environments & tools
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn

## Objective
Our main objective is to find the key factors that affect the match outcome and
select the best machine learning model that best fits this data and gives the best
results. 

Some works already have been published in this area of predicting the outcome of a cricket
match. In some papers, only a few key factors are taken for prediction so the
accuracy is less. Whereas in some papers the machine learning model is not
appropriate. So it is important to take all the key factors that can affect the match
outcome and as well as to select the best model for training and testing the data.
This will increase the prediction accuracy drastically.

## Future Improvements
•	Gathering a larger dataset and training on pre trained models using transfer learning would be the next step to further improve the model.

•	Our model could be improved by creating more optimized neural network.
